				p.pt-0.mt-3 Raised on the mountains of North Vancouver and the Kootenays, I was taught at a young age to observe my surroundings, learning to recognize the complex interconnections between society and the environment. To grow, I am continuously seeking to unlearn and learn new perspectives by meeting and working with diverse people to better conceptualize place and space and represent knowledge systems. I work closely with people, government, academic, and business partners to develop technological solutions that aim to better understand and support our diverse social and environmental landscape. For example, I have contributed to disaster mapping events and I have trained hunters on how to use GPS devices for monitoring. Though technology can offer opprotunities to better serve people and monitor the environment, it needs to be designed and built critically and ethically. This is what I hope to achieve through my work.
